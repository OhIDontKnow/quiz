# Quiz Adventure (working title)

Quiz Adventure (working title) is a fun trivia web game. The player's knowledge is put to the test as they answer a series of trivia questions. Afterwards, they are given a results to page to show how they did.

# MVP
The index.html page displays a body of text explaining the game rules. "About the Developers" information will possibly go here as well (if not, it will be placed at the end of the game). The index.html page also contains a text input field for the user to enter their name.

Once their name is submitted, the user is presented with a trivia question and four possible answers. Once answered, the user is brought to a "Game Over" screen, which shows a "You Won!" message if the user was correct. If incorrect, the user will see a "You Lose!" message.

Though simple at its core, this game will allow the team to add features to make it more interesting.

# Stretch Goals
*Allow up to 4 players in a game. Players would take turns playing each round, and would be prompted with different questions. A question will only appear once per game.

*Allow players to choose an avatar.

*Allow players to choose a difficulty setting.

*Display a "high score" table once the game is finished. If multiple players, show which player did best. High player scores are saved to localStorage to be displayed in future games.

*The player will only have a set amount of time to answer each question. The amount of time would scale to the chosen difficulty level.

*Divide the game into multiple rounds (for example, a full game can be 3 rounds of 3 questions each). Each round can have its own difficulty and/or subject (subjects can be either randomly determined, or chosen by the player). The number of rounds in a game can be determined by the player at the beginning of the game. 

*Add CSS polish such as intro/outro animations and mouseOver effects.
