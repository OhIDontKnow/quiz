# Quiz Adventure (working title)

Quiz Adventure (working title) is a fun trivia web game. The player's knowledge is put to the test as they answer a series of trivia questions. Afterwards, they are given a results to page to show how they did.

# MVP
The index.html page displays a body of text explaining the game rules. "About the Developers" information will possibly go here as well (if not, it will be placed at the end of the game). The index.html page also contains a text input field for the user to enter their name.

Once their name is submitted, the user is presented with a trivia question and four possible answers. Once answered, the user is brought to a "Game Over" screen, which shows a "You Won!" message if the user was correct. If incorrect, the user will see a "You Lose!" message.

Though simple at its core, this game will allow the team to add features to make it more interesting.

# Stretch Goals
