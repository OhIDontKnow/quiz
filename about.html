            Hello!

<p>We are a quiz based web application that asks users interesting trivia questions on unknown subjects. The four founding fathers established this application because they felt as if there weren’t enough hard, yet intellectually stimulating questions out there to challenge people. This application will make you think hard and you will have to search through every nook and cranny in your brain to find the right answer.
     The point of this quiz is for you to learn about things you didn't know you needed to learn. 
 Now start the quiz and get your brain gears turning!<p>
